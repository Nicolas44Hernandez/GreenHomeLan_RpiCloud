## **Topology**
![Topology](images/general_topology.png)

## [**rpi_box**](https://github.com/Nicolas44Hernandez/GreenHomeLan_RpiBox)
Runs the intelligence of the orchestrator, this RPI commands the Wi-Fi bands of the livebox via telnet and acts as a border router for the Thread network. This code could be integrated into the livebox in future versions.
The orchestrator notifies periodically the current use situation and the Wi-Fi status to the cloud server.

## [**rpi_relays**](https://github.com/Nicolas44Hernandez/GreenHomeLan_RpiPanel)
Connected electrical panel, this panel is controlled by the orchestrator to manage the energy resources of the house.
Currently, for demo purposes, three of its relays are used as a visual notification of the status of the Wi-Fi bands as follows:
- 2.4 GHz : red
- 5 GHz: yellow
- 6 GHz: white

## **rpi_cloud**
Run a web server where connected users receive notifications and have access to the live video stream from the rpi_camera
This module is not part of the local network, it simulates a cloud web service.

## [**rpi_camera**](https://github.com/Nicolas44Hernandez/GreenHomeLan_RpiCamera)
Connected object composed a doorbell, a camera and a presence sensor. This smart doorbell sends a notification and the live video stream to the cloud server (rpi_cloud) if someone rings the bell or the presence sensor detects something unusual.
## [**rpi_button**](https://github.com/Nicolas44Hernandez/GreenHomeLan_RpiButton)
Connected object composed a emergency button. This smart emergency button sends an alarm via thread to the orchestrator if someone press the button. This alarm is forwarded to the cloud server.

## [**rpi_buttons_actions**](https://github.com/Nicolas44Hernandez/GreenHomeLan_RpiButtons_Actions)
Connected object composed a 2x2 matrix buttons. When a button is pressed, this object sends a message via thread to the orchestrator to request the execution of an specific command (the commands to run can be configured by the user).
